This program was based on the weather.py script distributed by the PiFace team:

It was modified extensively by Zach White <zwhite@darkstar.frop.org> to add
many features:

* Config file support
* Command line arguments
* Configurable output format
* Multiple format support
* Continual refreshing so it's always up to date
